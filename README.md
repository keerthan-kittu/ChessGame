♟️ Chess Game in Python ♟️
🎮 Built with Python and Pygame
✨ About the Game
I developed my own Chess Game using Python, leveraging the Pygame library to create a fully interactive and visually appealing chessboard. This project showcases my skills in game development, GUI design, and algorithm implementation. It follows standard chess rules and allows two players to play against each other on the same system.

🎨 Features and Design
✔️ Beautiful Chessboard UI – The game has an elegant and clear chessboard with high-quality piece images.
✔️ Smooth Piece Movement – Click and drag to move pieces with real-time visual feedback.
✔️ Rule Enforcement – Legal moves are automatically validated to prevent invalid moves.
✔️ Turn-Based Gameplay – The game enforces turns, allowing White and Black to play alternately.
✔️ Move Highlighting – Possible moves are highlighted for better visibility.
✔️ Check and Checkmate Detection – The game notifies when a player is in check or checkmate.

🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Python – Core language for logic and game mechanics.
🔹 Pygame – Used for rendering the chessboard, handling graphics, and managing events.
🔹 FEN Notation – Board state representation for tracking positions and game progress.
🔹 Minimax Algorithm (Future Update) – Potential AI opponent for single-player mode.

🎯 Future Improvements
🔹 AI Opponent – Implement a chess engine for single-player mode.
🔹 Undo/Redo Moves – Add functionality to revert or repeat moves.
🔹 Online Multiplayer – Enable players to compete over the internet.

This project not only strengthened my Python skills but also deepened my understanding of game logic, AI, and user experience design.
